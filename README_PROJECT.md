# City Temperature Management API

This is a FastAPI-based backend application for managing cities and their temperature data.
The application allows creating cities with geographic coordinates and fetching current
temperature data using an external weather service.

---

## 🚀 Features

- CRUD operations for cities
- Store latitude and longitude for each city
- Fetch current temperature for cities
- Store temperature records
- Async SQLAlchemy with SQLite
- FastAPI automatic API documentation

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python 3.12+
- FastAPI
- SQLAlchemy (async)
- SQLite
- HTTPX
- Uvicorn

## ▶️ How to Run the Application

### 1️⃣ Create and activate virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # macOS / Linux
.venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows

2️⃣ Install dependencies
pip install fastapi uvicorn sqlalchemy aiosqlite httpx

3️⃣ Initialize database
python app/db/init_db.py

4️⃣ Run the application
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload

5️⃣ Open API documentation
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

📌 API Endpoints
Cities

POST /cities/ — create a city

GET /cities/{id} — get city by ID

PUT /cities/{id} — update city

DELETE /cities/{id} — delete city

Temperatures

GET /temperatures/ — get all temperature records

GET /temperatures/?city_id={id} — get temperatures for a specific city

POST /temperatures/update — fetch and store current temperatures for all cities

🧠 Design Choices

FastAPI was chosen for its performance, async support, and built-in API documentation.

Async SQLAlchemy is used to avoid blocking database operations.

The application is split into logical domains (cities, temperatures).

External weather API logic is isolated in the services layer.

⚠️ Assumptions & Simplifications

SQLite is used for simplicity and local development.

No authentication or authorization is implemented.

Temperature updates are triggered manually via an API endpoint.

External API error handling is minimal.
